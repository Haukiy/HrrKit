        **Instructions**
        1) Attach raw CSV file(s) by drag-and-drop below (GitHub will insert links).
        2) For each attachment, fill out the following block (IDs can simply be 1, 2, 3... **for this issue only**—we handle the global IDs in the CSV). Filenames are generated automatically from your inputs + a hash.

           ```
           ID: <per-issue number>
           Scource in IDEEE: <who provided the data>
           Topic: <topic name>
           Time Unit: <e.g., s>
           Energy Unit: <e.g., kW>
           Attachment filename: <the name GitHub inserts after you upload the file>
           ```

        3) Repeat the block for every file you are submitting and paste the combined text into the field below.
        4) When ready, comment **`/validate`** on the issue to run Phase 1 (validation). Once it succeeds, comment **`/intake-commit`** to run Phase 2 (processing + commit).
